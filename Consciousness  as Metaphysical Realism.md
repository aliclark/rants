# Consciousness as Metaphysical Realism

*Originally created 16th January 2024*

## Theory

Suppose that conscious experience is an accident which evolution stumbled upon because it was helpful *in itself* for evolutionary survival.

If that were so, either conscious experience is somehow informationarily useful to an organism, or it is useful as an incentivisation mechanism, or both.

How is it actually implemented?

Is it like an oil painting that one can efficiently tend to specific details, and make efficient alterations as needed with a brush?

Or is it like an orchestra, where every musician sends out a different sound and it arrives at the condictor and audience, whose arm movement and facial expressions help guide the future action of the orchestra?
