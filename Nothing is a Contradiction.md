# Nothing is a Contradiction

Most of current Ontology boils down to a brute fact: there is a God, there is Mathematics, there is a Universe, there is Value, there is Mind, or there is a Potentiality.

Here I outline an alternative to the above, in order to answer the question "Why is there something rather than nothing?".

The argument hinges on 'Nothing'. Whereas philosophers have frequently spoken of Nothing in the past, I believe it is a critical mistake. Ontological Nothing cannot be, by definition. Therefore, non-nothing must be, however specified. But without a causal specifier, it is non-nothing, without specification.

This provides a plausible theory for the most critical axiom of all, Existence.

Happily, since it is unconstrained around the Existing, it gives plenty of room for that which is existing: to be a mathematical object(s), universe(s), or God(s). Perhaps the same thing.

## Discussion

Firstly I'd like to add a reminder that as the Buddha taught, all pain is illusory.

Secondly the argument I've outlined above does not yet ensure that the law of cause and effect is mandatory. If it were to be the case and not an illusion, there would need to be some restriction on what is existing, such that it is not infinite. Potentially it could be due to a hitherto undiscovered law of ontology, or it could be as a result of god.
