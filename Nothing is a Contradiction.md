# Nothing is a Contradiction

*Originally created 7th June 2023*

> Nothingness if it is supported by being, vanishes qua nothingness, and we fall back upon
being. Nothingness can be nihilated only on the foundation of being; if nothingness can be
given, it is neither before nor after being, nor in a general way outside of being. Nothingness
lies coiled in the heart of being—like a worm.
<br>- Jean-Paul Satre

Most of current Ontology boils down to a brute fact: there is a God, there is Mathematics, there is a Universe, there is Value, there is Mind, or there is Actuality (and Potentiality).

Here I outline an alternative to the above, in order to answer the question "Why is there something rather than nothing?".

The argument hinges on 'Nothing'. Whereas philosophers have frequently spoken of Nothing in the past, like Russell I believe it is a critical mistake. Ontological Nothing cannot be, by definition, as explained by Satre. Therefore, non-nothing must be, however specified. But without a causal specifier, it is non-nothing, without specification.

This provides a plausible theory for the most critical axiom of all, Existence.

Happily, since it is unconstrained around the Existing, it gives plenty of room for that which is existing: to be a mathematical object(s), universe(s), God(s), Mind(s). Perhaps the same thing.

## Explanation

The argument is that Actuality is explained in the more basic fact of non non-Actuality. A statement of Actuality as fact by itself is unsatisfactory, because it doesn't appropriately answer the question of Why. But "non-Nothing" can be seen as correct not just in experience but also in being able to follow the absence of a contradictory How (ie. the thesis could be disproved simply by presenting an existent Nothing, but logically this cannot and will not occur). So the clarified exposition gives Actuality and also the foundational understanding of Why there is Actuality - which is rooted in the non-existence of Nothing, owing to its definitional impossibility.

There has never been Nothing, never will be Nothing, never could be Nothing. If Nothing *is*, then it is something not Nothing. If it is not, then it *is not* (Nothing). Because it could not, it did not. And because it did not, there was not Nothing. Necessarily, there was Something by the absence of Nothing, which is the inverse of Something. One may be tempted to say that the possibility "it *is not* (Nothing)" is itself a viable outcome (akin to an unnamed Nothing), and it is! But a Nothing that *is not* it is not unnamed Nothing, is is Something.

Although I have talked of non-Nothing, and non non-Actuality as though they may be causes of Actuality, since these have no basis anywhere the truth is they are only descriptive of the absence of alternatives to Actuality, therefore it can be said that Actuality is Causeless, and it must be asserted that this is in fact a possible, necessary even, attribute for a root axiom.

One may even further decide to ascribe to the theory that there isn't *anything* that is the effect of a cause, that instead the full universe simply is Actualized at once, including travel along its time dimension. One may say that the Buddha's and Aristotle's treatments of Causality were successful theories in Natural Science up to a point (that point being 1824, with Thermodynamic Time being discovered by Sadi Carnot), but that they do not have applicability in the realm of Metaphysics.

I believe Satre was too poetic when it got to the point of ontology - because his focus was more on existentialism, he poetically states "Nothingness
lies coiled in the heart of being—like a worm". This is problematic as an ontological argument if one agrees with Parmenides that "Nothing comes from nothing" - one still needs to pick one of the standard ontological roots then: God, Mind, Value, etc.

This problem disappears if one takes the Frege and Russell position that Nothing is only illusory and/or explanatory. If we take that position we don't agree with the coiled worm analogy. Nonetheless, the argument against Nothing by Satre is true.

I find Hegel's dialectical relationship between being and nothingness helpful as a metaphor, but only that. Due to Parmenides, Frege and Russell I think it isn't quite right to say Being is definitionally in relation to Nothing. Just that we could explain Being after the fact using the intellectual concept of negation and the intellectual concept of Nothing, and I believe Hegel was going further than that.

In a sense one could perhaps describe this post straightforwardly as: Parmenides' Ontology, but swapping in Frege, Russell and ultimately Satre's explanation of Nothing in place of Parmenides' one.

However doing so leads to a philosophical contribution to Metaphysical Ontology, which is to provide a logical from-principles explanation for Actuality, and at the same time giving an explanation for why this Actuality is Uncaused and without even a prime mover.

## Discussion

This philosophical argument aims to serve as part of a map, but a map is not the territory. The spiritual and religious practices and (perhaps) skepticism give better tools for understanding the territory, the experience of existing.

For similar reasons, I think that of the above the Mind (Only) interpretation of existence is perhaps the most helpful orientation, or God and a Genesis-based interpretation for the theologically inclined (although there is obviously a lot unsaid about the existence of an active God - if a sufficient amount could be said then we would instead use a different term).

The argument does not yet ensure that the law of cause and effect is mandatory in all of existence. If there are an unbounded set of causes and an unbounded set of effects existing in their own right, it would make the law of cause and effect a moot point, even if there do exist fuller, more properly defined universes which do fully abide to it. Potentially there could be an ontological enforcement of cause and effect owing to a hitherto undiscovered law of ontology, or could be as a result of God. This point is academic, since we have no ability to discern the actual nature of causes, which lie in the past. But it seems a natural line of enquiry to attempt to clarify.

I'd like to add a reminder that as the Buddha taught, suffering arises from a misapprehension of self. This isn't intended to downplay suffering, but might be helpful for accepting its existence in the universe and potentially beyond. It also seems likely that due to the continuous and interconnected nature of the universe, it is not possible to create any (or at least a diverse) universe with sentience but without that including suffering as part of the spectrum of experience.

I think the most plausible description of the nature of that which is existing is that whatever it is, it is (at least initially) singular, and unbounded. To me it seems quite implausible that the first ontological object would be of a countable nature, or even objectifiable at all. "Singular and unbounded", or more simply "unbounded" seems to straightforwardly provide a route past that specificity.

## Further work

Investigation into more ontological contradictions, and constraints on that which is existing.

### Known prior work
- Parmenides reached essentially the same conclusions and argued that Nothing is impossible, but the argument is much weaker because it is based on a disqualification rooted in our subjective legibility being in some way a "cause" (ironic and weak reasoning... "He is no other than myself, And yet I am not he") rather than an absolute contradiction (and impossibility) of the intrinsics. I posit that when we can describe, it is simply a position of pure *luxury* of existing, rather than of any necessity.
- Hegel - a dialectical relationship between being and nothingness
- Gottlob Frege - "nothing" (like 0) is special, it refers to absence
- Bertrand Russell - it is an error to treat "nothing" as a subject that exists
- Jean-Paul Satre - explained the logical contradiction of Nothing. A lot of his surrounding thought has existentialism and human psychology as its reference point rather than ontology, but nonetheless this argument carries to ontological nothing.
- Thank you to Robert Lawrence Kuhn for the TV Series *Closer to Truth*, which gave a very good overview and introduction to the topic.
- Some philosphy has argued that asking of Nothing is meaningless, but more from the angle that a "Nothing" would require a Truth to assert it, and that presence of Truth would contradict there being Nothing, hence there is not Nothing. I don't believe this is quite the same as arguing that Nothing by its own definition is impossible to exist, and I don't think the other formulation is as helpful a foundation. For one thing, it sort of replaces Actuality as the primary axiom with some concept "Truth", which is not in the least bit helpful. But saying there is no Non-Actuality is post hoc explanatory and not relying on any concept of Truth, it merely relays the definition and leaves Actuality as the only viability, hence the question is answered: it could not have been otherwise, or better, "(this) is".
