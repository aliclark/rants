# Nothing is a Contradiction

*Originally created 7th June 2023*

Most of current Ontology boils down to a brute fact: there is a God, there is Mathematics, there is a Universe, there is Value, there is Mind, or there is Actuality (and Potentiality).

Here I outline an alternative to the above, in order to answer the question "Why is there something rather than nothing?".

The argument hinges on 'Nothing'. Whereas philosophers have frequently spoken of Nothing in the past, I believe it is a critical mistake. Ontological Nothing cannot be, by definition. Therefore, non-nothing must be, however specified. But without a causal specifier, it is non-nothing, without specification.

This provides a plausible theory for the most critical axiom of all, Existence.

Happily, since it is unconstrained around the Existing, it gives plenty of room for that which is existing: to be a mathematical object(s), universe(s), God(s), Mind(s). Perhaps the same thing.

## Explanation

The argument is that Actuality is explained in the more basic fact of non non-Actuality. A statement of Actuality as fact by itself is unsatisfactory, because it doesn't appropriately answer the question of Why. But "non-Nothing" can be seen as correct not just in experience but also in being able to follow the absence of a contradictory How (ie. the thesis could be disproved simply by presenting an existent Nothing, but logically this cannot and will not occur). So the clarified exposition gives Actuality and also the foundational understanding of Why there is Actuality - which is rooted in the non-existence of Nothing, owing to its definitional impossibility.

## Discussion

This philosophical argument aims to serve as part of a map, but a map is not the territory. The Buddha's Eightfold Path and Mindfulness and Descartes's "I think, therefore I am" are (perhaps) better tools for understanding the territory, the experience of existing.

For similar reasons, I think that of the above the Mind (Only) interpretation of existence is perhaps the most helpful orientation, or God and a Genesis-based interpretation for the theologically inclined (although there is obviously a lot unsaid about the existence of an active God - if a sufficient amount could be said then we would instead use a different term).

The argument does not yet ensure that the law of cause and effect is mandatory in all of existence. If there are infinite causes and infinite effects existing in their own right, it would make the law of cause and effect a moot point, even if there do exist fuller, more properly defined universes which do fully abide to it. Potentially there could be an ontological enforcement of cause and effect owing to a hitherto undiscovered law of ontology, or could be as a result of God. This point is academic, since we have no ability to discern the actual nature of causes, which lie in the past. But it seems a natural line of enquiry to attempt to clarify.

I'd like to add a reminder that as the Buddha taught, suffering arises from a misapprehension of self. This isn't intended to downplay suffering, but might be helpful for accepting its existence in the universe and potentially beyond.

I think the most plausible description of the nature of that which is existing is that whatever it is, it is (at least initially) singular, and unbounded. To me it seems quite implausible that the first ontological object would be of a countable nature, or even objectifiable at all. "Singular and unbounded", or more simply "unbounded" seems to straightforwardly provide a route past that specificity.

## Further work

Investigation into more ontological contradictions, and constraints on that which is existing.

### Known prior work
- The theory is simple enough that I assume this to exist and therefore do not assume this to be a novel theory, unless a well-versed expert can reassure otherwise.
- Some philosphy has argued that asking of Nothing is meaningless, but more from the angle that a "Nothing" would require a Truth to assert it, and that presence of Truth would contradict there being Nothing, hence there is not Nothing. I don't believe this is quite the same as arguing that Nothing by its own definition is impossible to exist, and I don't think the other formulation is as helpful a foundation. For one thing, it sort of replaces Actuality as the primary axiom with some concept "Truth", which is not in the least bit helpful. But saying Non-Actuality has no Actuality is not relying on any concept of truth, it merely relays the definition.
