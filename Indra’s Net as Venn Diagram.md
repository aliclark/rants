# Indra's Net as Venn Diagram

*Originally created 22nd January 2025*

Since writing [Nothing is a Contradiction](Nothing%20is%20a%20Contradiction.md), I've wanted to reconcile the fact that it left Philosophical Skeptical as perhaps the most obvious implication in an Ockham’s Razor sense, with what our experience itself seems to tell us, that we live in a larger Universe which is not merely the discrete moments of experience that Philosophical Skepticism only allows us to admit.

## Theory

### Refutation of Philosophical Skepticism

1. Firstly we could say that *Nothing is a Contradiction* **also** seems to imply that there could be any number of existing universes compatible with the experience you are having right now.

2. We can also say that we expect things to exist ontologically only if it's possible for it to exist ontologically, and that if a thing is self-contradictory, it is not possible for it to exist. So taking the inverse, only a self-consistent thing can exist ontologically.

3. We might empirically take the sheer complexity of the present experience to be strongly suggestive of ontological infinities underlying, even if we humans have difficulty formalizing it effectively within mathematics.

4. We could also say 'non-nothing' is equal to 'non-nothing without constraints', since we lack “sufficient reason” for why it should be constrained. A bound would be a constraint, so this is the same as 'unbounded non-nothing'.

5. The Philosophically Skeptical experience is the single *minimal* universe that could possibly explain your present experience. There is exactly K=1 such universes.

6. But there are also an infinite number of possible self-consistent universes that are more complex than a Philosophically Skeptical universe, that are also compatible with your present experience.

7. Because they are possible to exist, and non-nothing is unconstrained, they do exist.

8. So your present experience exists within a self-consistent universe that is more complex than the Philosophical Skepticism universe. From the viewpoint of your current experience, 0% likelihood should be placed on the bet that it is the universe where Philosophical Skepticism is correct, if you accept the previous arguments and assumptions.

9. In fact this is true for any K specifying an amount of complexity.

10. So from the viewpoint of your current experience, 0% likelihood should be placed on the bet that it is a universe with a low complexity, below some constant K.

### Support for Indra's Net

11. I have so far made arguments 3 and 4 to support an ontology which is an infinite plurality of possible universes. It doesn't seem outright impossible that our universe could exist while at the same time some completely distinct universe also exists, nor that ontology couldn't accomodate infinite existences.

12. There is traditionally a conflict between viewing Ontology as Monist versus a Plurality of Universes. I believe there is an ontological representation that overcomes the traditional contradiction of Ontological Monism vs. Ontological Plurality of Universes, which is Indra's Net.

13. For purposes here, it is easier to understand through the metaphor of a sprawling Venn Diagram (wider than the width of 2 circles). In this way we can see that a Universe may exist on one side of the Venn Diagram that is wholly different and distinct from another Universe on another side of the Venn Diagram. However, although this seems like a Plurality of Universes, they are in fact connected via a network of related Universes, so that in fact the ontology is a Monist whole.

### Comments

14. We could very speculatively describe our current Universe as being the overlap of 2 fundamentally distinct laws, General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, that is our Universe exists only where the laws are in compatibility. Our universe would then be related to other universes that share one or both of those theories and perhaps others. The overlap with our universe might be only at points of singularity, for universes that have drastically different laws, however it could also be in "normal" finite regions, in cases of quantum mechanics.

15. This shouldn't be understood as a bet against Quantum Gravity - the Venn Diagram nature means that there can be many valid and compatible, but different, universes overlapping with each other coinciding exact same relative experiences.
