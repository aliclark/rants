I ascribe philosophically to academic skepticism (I think). As a skeptic, I believe it is false to hold skepticism, or any other belief for that matter; and the same as a determinist and buddhist. As it is false to hold determinism, it is false to hold fatalism. Whenever I have the luxury of an explanation, I favour a scientific approach supported by metaphysical realism for the theories to hold better by Ockhamâ€™s Razor.
