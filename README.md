I ascribe philosophically to academic skepticism (I think). As a skeptic, I believe it is false to hold skepticism, or any other belief for that matter, and the same as a determinist and buddhist. But whenever I have the luxury of an explanation, I favour a scientific or empirical approach supported by pragmatism and rationalism, including metaphysical realism for the theories to hold better under Ockhamâ€™s Razor.
