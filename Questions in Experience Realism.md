# Questions in Experience Realism

*Originally created 13th January 2024*

## Questions

What is the realism of experience (qualia)?

- Are there a finite and small (eg. 32) number of ways to experience "red", as a human?
- Are there a finite and quite large number of ways to experience "red", as a being, such that it could require an alien brain and/or a psychadelic to experience most of them?
- Are there infinite variations of ways to experience "red", such that every single experience of "red" ever will always be an experience of a slightly different brightness of it?
- Is it impossible to delineate or demarcate the different kinds of a conscious experience from one another, so that essentially every conscious experience that ever exists is a single, indivisble experience that will likely never exist for another being?
- are there any other options?

In the above thought experiments I assume that there is some distribution of skew in sensory perception such that evem if two beings have genuinely different sensory perception, the cumulative effect over many beings will cause sensory skew to be statistically cancelled.
