# Indra's Venn Diagram

*Originally created 22nd January 2025*

Since writing [Nothing is a Contradiction](Nothing%20is%20a%20Contradiction.md), I've wanted to reconcile the fact that it left Philosophical Skeptical as perhaps the most obvious implication in an Ockhamâ€™s Razor sense, with what our experience itself seems to tell us, that we live in a larger Universe which is not merely the discrete moments of experience that Philosophical Skepticism only allows us to admit.

## Theory

1. Firstly we could say that *Nothing is a Contradiction* **also** seems to imply that there could be any number of existing universes compatible with the experience you are having right now.

2. We can also say that we expect things to exist ontologically only if it's possible for it to exist ontologically, and that if a thing is self-contradictory, it is not possible for it to exist. So taking the inverse, only a self-consistent thing can exist ontologically.

3. The Philosophically Skeptical experience is the single *minimal* universe that could possibly explain your present experience. There is exactly K=1 such universes.

4. We might take the sheer complexity of the present experience to be strongly suggestive of ontological infinities, even if we humans have difficulty formalizing it effectively within mathematics.

5. But there are also an infinite number of possible self-consistent universes that are more complex than, but also compatible with your present experience.

6. So the weight of probability states that your present experience exists within a self-consistent universe that is more complex than the Philosophical Skepticism universe. ie. Philosophical Skepticism is infintessimally unlikely to be correct, if you accept the previous arguments and assumptions.

5. In fact this is true for any K specifying an amount of complexity.

6. So the weight of probability states that your present experience exists within something much closer to an infinitely complex self-consistent universe.

7. I have so far made arguments assuming an ontological scenario of an infinite plurality of possible universes (which is not totally unfounded - it doesn't seem outright impossible that our universe could exist while at the same time some completely distinct universe also exists, nor that ontology couldn't accomodate boundless existences - if anything bounded existence feels less obvious a scenario).

8. There is traditionally a conflict between viewing Ontology as Monist versus a Plurality of Universes. I believe there is an ontological representation that overcomes the traditional contradiction of Ontological Monism vs. Ontological Plurality of Universes, which is Indra's Net.

9. For purposes here, it is easier to understand as a sprawling Venn Diagram. In this way we can see that a Universe may exist on one side of the Venn Diagram that is wholly different and distinct from another Universe on another side of the Venn Diagram. However, all though this seems like a Plurality of Universes, they are in fact connected via a network of related Universes, so that in fact the ontology is a Monist whole.

10. We could very speculatively describe our current Universe as being the overlap of 2 fundamentally distinct laws, General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, that is our Universe only where the laws are in compatibility. Our universe would then be related to other universes that share one or both of those theories and perhaps others. The overlap with our universe may be only at points of singularity.

11. This shouldn't be understood as a bet against Quantum Gravity - the Venn Diagram nature means that there can be several valid and compatiblle, but different, universes overlapping with each other coinciding exact same relative experiences.
