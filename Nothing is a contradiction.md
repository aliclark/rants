# Nothing is a contradiction

Most of current Ontology boils down to a brute fact: there is a God, there is Mathematics, there is a Universe, there is Value, there is Mind, or there is a Potentiality.

Here I outline an alternative to the above, in order to answer the question "Why is there something rather than nothing?".

The argument hinges on 'Nothing'. Whereas philosophers have frequently spoken of Nothing in the past, I believe it is a critical mistake. Ontological Nothing cannot be, by definition. Therefore, non-nothing must be, however specified. But without a causal specifier, it is non-nothing, without specification.

This provides a plausible theory for the most critical axiom of all, Existence.

Happily, since it is unconstrained around the Existing, it gives plenty of room for that which is existing: to be a mathematical object(s), universe(s), or God(s). Perhaps the same thing.

## Discussion

The conclusions are rather stark, as the axiom of Existence alone seems to imply that not only might we have no free will, but that the universe is not even constrained merely to "reasonable" scenarios. Should we always be in fear that we will do something drastic or unexpected next, or one moment find that we have already done so? At best, it seems to turn life into the discovery of whether your own life is becoming that of a paradise or a horror story.

At this point, I will note two things.

Firstly all religions and many great philosophers have described good action and exercise of one's free will, as a relevant or central aspect to life. We should take a moment's pause before completely throwing all of that out, in favour extrapolating from a raw axiom.

Secondly there is nothing about the axiom of Existence which precludes the existence of an active God. It may just as well be that such a God would use their unlimited power to scrub out all the existences where free will was *not* central, or really, anything.

As a result, I think it's more than worthwhile to spend time looking into theology in combination with philosophy and religion to try to understand our place within existence. The quest is not over - it has only just begun!
