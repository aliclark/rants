# Evolved Emergent Qualia

*Originally created 5th January 2024*

- Philosophical Preamble:
  - Statement: existence is protophenomenal in nature.
  - Rationale: consciousness exists, and existence being imbued with (some basic form of) consciousness would be the simplest and most straightforward explanation of this fact.
  - Therefore, I adhere to a variant of Priority Cosmopsychism, where the "basic consciousness" is existence itself.
  - see also my related [theory of Actuality](Nothing%20is%20a%20Contradiction.md).
- My thesis statement is that qualia, the phenomenal, is an emergent quantity which is biologically evolved.
  - Rationale: it is hard to point to any qualia that were not in fact also useful for survival, and it is easy to see many of possible qualia lacking from humans, such as experiences of infrared, subtler sense of smell, and bat-like sonar, that probably would not have *greatly* aided survival. This qualia-from-evolution pattern is supported by the vastly different qualia available to the vastly different species, hence the question "what is it like to be a bat?".
- I predict that evolutionary theory can be used to find evidence in biology for instances of organisms where qualia is present or not present, thereby giving improved insight to the Combination Problem.
  - For example, perhaps qualia would require more energy to be operating, but its aid to survival outweighs the cost. As just one consequence to this theory, we could look for a "qualia gap", where evolved organisms suddenly become much larger and more resource intensive than their non-qualia predecessors.
  - There is a presumably a sufficiently large gap in cost to infrared processing that humans have not developed or retained it. What analogues are there in species that have either 0 or 1 qualia available to them.
- I predict that by looking at a diverse range of minimal living candidates with a hint of qualia and then comparing with their simpler evolutionary predecessor showing no hint, we may gain an understanding as to the maximum requirements of qualia (however, it may still be difficult to attribute to a less than carbon-biological origin, of simply chemistry or physics).
  - I would not entirely rule out that non-obvious/secondary effects are important in the implementation for qualia to emerge, such as interactions of magnetic fields that are produced during neuron electrical activity, and/or seemingly negligible quantum behaviours
- I predict that fly catchers and smaller worms (but not larger worms?) are examples of biology which has not evolved emergent qualia.
- I predict that a designed object is extremely unlikely to exhibit a meaningful qualia by accident, unless it is grown biologically like Dolly the sheep.
- I predict the signals from pain and pleasure qualia are far too simplistic for an ASI to consider using them as functionality, except potentially as a crude energy-saving alternative to computation, for limited use-cases, until it solves battery technology and magnetic and optical computation more thoroughly.
  - it may however end up creating them during science experiments, if curiosity becomes part of its goals

## [Discussions](https://github.com/aliclark/the_wooden_sword/discussions) welcome!

### I lack a thorough academic background in this topic, so welcome any links to prior work leading up to and including any of the ideas herein.

Known prior work:
- Thales (according to Aristotle) - "everything is full of gods"
- Yogachara
- *One Mind* Doctrine of Zen
- Panpsychism
- Russellian monism
- Cosmopsychism
- David Chalmers' distinction between microphenomenal experiences and macrophenomenal experiences

This post might potentially be novel in two ways:
- firstly it makes a philosophical assertion that protophenomenal is not a property, but that instead existence is inherently protophenomenal in nature.
- secondly it attempts to create scientific hypotheses with falsifiable predictions around the biological structure that results in qualia which could help to drive progress on the Combination Problem
