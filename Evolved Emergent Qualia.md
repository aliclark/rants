# Evolved Emergent Qualia

*Originally created 5th January 2024*

- I philosophically adhere to a variant of Priority Cosmopsychism, where the "basic consciousness" is existence itself. I assert that existence is protophenomenal.
  - see also my related [theory of Actuality](Nothing%20is%20a%20Contradiction.md).
- I hypothesise that qualia, the phenomenal, is an emergent quantity which is biologically evolved.
  - Rationale: it is hard to point to any qualia that were not in fact also useful for survival
- I predict that evolutionary theory can be used to find evidence in biology for instances of organisms where qualia is present or not present.
  - For example, perhaps qualia would require more energy to be operating, but its aid to survival outweighs the cost. As just one consequence to this theory, we could look for a "qualia gap", where evolved organisms suddenly become much larger and more resource intensive than their non-qualia predecessors.
- I predict that by looking at a diverse range of minimal living candidates with a hint of qualia and then comparing with their simpler evolutionary predecessor showing no hint, we may gain an understanding as to the maximum requirements of qualia (however, it may still be difficult to attribute to a less than carbon-biological origin, of simply chemistry or physics).
  - I would not entirely rule out that non-obvious/secondary effects are important in the implementation for qualia to emerge, such as interactions of magnetic fields that are produced during neuron electrical activity, and/or seemingly negligible quantum behaviours
- I predict that fly catchers and smaller worms (but not larger worms?) are examples of biology which has not evolved emergent qualia.
- I predict that a designed object is extremely unlikely to exhibit a meaningful qualia by accident, unless it is grown biologically like Dolly the sheep.
- I predict the signals from pain and pleasure qualia are far too simplistic for an ASI to consider using them as functionality, except potentially as a crude energy-saving alternative to computation, for limited use-cases, until it solves battery technology and magnetic and optical computation more thoroughly.
  - it may however end up creating them during science experiments, if curiosity becomes part of its goals

## [Discussions](https://github.com/aliclark/the_wooden_sword/discussions) welcome!

### I lack a thorough academic background in this topic, so welcome any links to prior work leading up to and including any of the ideas herein.

Known prior work:
- Thales (according to Aristotle) - "everything is full of gods"
- Yogachara
- *One Mind* Doctrine of Zen
- Panpsychism
- Panexperientialism
- Panprotopsychism
- Cosmopsychism
- Panexperientalism
- David Chalmers' distinction between microphenomenal experiences and macrophenomenal experiences

This work is an attempt to present ideas from the philosophy above in terms of scientific hypotheses with falsifiable predictions - I think science can make some progress on this problem, albeit possibly not all of it. I welcome links to any other prior work along these lines.
