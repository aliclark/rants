# Evolved Emergent Qualia

- I hypothesise that the basic unit of qualia is existence itself, from metaphysical axiom
- I hypothesise that the experience of higher level qualia evolved over time, and uses more energy but aids survival
- I predict that by looking at a diverse ramge of minimal candidates with a hint of higher level qualia, then comparing with their simpler evolutionary predecessor, we can gain a good understanding as to the biological, chemical, or physical configuration necessary for higher level qualia.
- I predict that a designed object is extremely unlikely to exhibit higher level qualia by accident, unless biological (like Dolly the sheep)
