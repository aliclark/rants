# Evolved Emergent Qualia

- I hypothesise that the basis for qualia is existence itself, [from metaphysical axiom](Nothing%20is%20a%20Contradiction.md)
- I hypothesise that qualia is an emergent quantity which is biologically evolved. It perhaps uses more energy to achieve, but aids survival outeighing its cost.
- I predict that by looking at a diverse range of minimal living candidates with a hint of higher level qualia, then comparing with their simpler evolutionary predecessor, we can gain a good understanding as to the biological, chemical, or physical configuration necessary for higher level qualia. At what stages along the human evolutionary path did higher level qualia emerge, and why?
- I predict that a designed object is extremely unlikely to exhibit higher level qualia by accident, unless it is grown biologically (like Dolly the sheep). The signals from pain and pleasure qualia are far too simplistic for an ASI to consider using them, except potentially as a crude energy-saving alternative to computation, for limited use-cases, until it solves battery technology and magnetic and optical computation more thoroughly.
