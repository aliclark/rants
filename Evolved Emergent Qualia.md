# Evolved Emergent Qualia

- I hypothesise that the basis for qualia is existence itself, [from metaphysical axiom](Nothing%20is%20a%20Contradiction.md).
- I hypothesise that qualia is an emergent quantity which is biologically evolved. It perhaps uses more energy to be operational, but its aid to survival outeighs its cost.
- I predict that by looking at a diverse range of minimal living candidates with a hint of qualia and then comparing with their simpler evolutionary predecessor showing no hint, we may gain an understanding as to the maximum requirements of qualia (however, it may be difficult to attribute it to a less than biological origin of simply chemistry or physics).
- I hypothesise that fly catchers and worms are examples of biology which has not evolved emergent qualia.
- I predict that a designed object is extremely unlikely to exhibit a meaningful qualia by accident, unless it is grown biologically like Dolly the sheep. The signals from pain and pleasure qualia are far too simplistic for an ASI to consider using them, except potentially as a crude energy-saving alternative to computation, for limited use-cases, until it solves battery technology and magnetic and optical computation more thoroughly.
