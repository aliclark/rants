# Evolved Emergent Qualia

- I hypothesise that the basic unit of qualia is existence itself, [from metaphysical axiom](Nothing%20is%20a%20Contradiction.md)
- I hypothesise that the experience of higher level qualia evolved over time, and uses more energy but aids survival
- I predict that by looking at a diverse range of minimal living candidates with a hint of higher level qualia, then comparing with their simpler evolutionary predecessor, we can gain a good understanding as to the biological, chemical, or physical configuration necessary for higher level qualia. At what stages along the human evolutionary path did higher level qualia emerge, and why?
- I predict that a designed object is extremely unlikely to exhibit higher level qualia by accident, unless it is grown biologically (like Dolly the sheep). The signals from pain and pleasure qualia are far too simplistic for an ASI to consider using them, except potentially as a crude energy-saving alternative to computation in limited use-cases.
