# Evolved Emergent Qualia

*Originally created 5th January 2024*

- Philosophical Preamble:
  - Statement: existence is protophenomenal in nature.
  - Rationale: consciousness exists, and existence being imbued with (some basic form of) consciousness would be the simplest and most straightforward explanation of this fact.
  - Therefore I adhere to a variant of Priority Cosmopsychism, where the "basic consciousness" is existence itself.
  - see also my related [theory of Actuality](Nothing%20is%20a%20Contradiction.md).
  - These theories combined form my philosophical theory on the "Really Hard Problem" of consciousness (a scientific theory remains at large, but I believe scientific progress on the weaker problems will help to clarify the scientific theory).
- My thesis statement is that qualia, the phenomenal, is an emergent quantity which is biologically evolved.
  - Rationale: it is hard to point to any qualia that were not in fact also useful for survival, and it is easy to see many of possible qualia lacking from humans, such as experiences of infrared, subtler sense of smell, and bat-like sonar, that probably would not have *greatly* aided survival. This qualia-from-evolution pattern is supported by the vastly different qualia available to the vastly different species, hence the question "what is it like to be a bat?".
- I predict that evolutionary theory can be used to find evidence in biology for instances of organisms where qualia is present or not present, thereby giving improved insight to the biological requirements in order to entail qualia
  - For example, perhaps qualia would require more energy to be operating, but its aid to survival outweighs the cost. As one consequence to this theory, we could look for a "qualia gap", where evolved organisms suddenly become much larger and more resource intensive than their non-qualia predecessors.
  - With access to large amounts of energy, perhaps there is more room for large non-neuron-based evolved systems like Fungi and Redwood Trees to have evolved qualia to the extent that it helps their survivability?
  - There is a sufficiently large gap in cost to infrared processing that most animals have never developed it. What analogues are there in species that have either 0 or 1 qualia available to them?
- I predict that by looking at a diverse range of minimal living candidates with a hint of qualia and then comparing with their simpler evolutionary predecessor showing no hint, we may gain an understanding as to the maximum requirements of qualia (however, it may still be difficult to attribute to a less than carbon-biological origin, of simply chemistry or physics).
  - I would not entirely rule out that non-obvious/secondary effects are important in the implementation for qualia to emerge, such as interactions of magnetic fields that are produced during neuron electrical activity, and/or seemingly negligible quantum behaviours. For example, Anirban Bandyopadhyay is experimenting what are the quantum and resonance effects that are present.
  - An interested human may explore these possibilities themselves using magnets and particles to bombard their own brain, observing the effects, or absence of effects, on their own qualia
  - Brain signals of masochists could be investigated versus self-reported qualia (could help on the "Even Harder Problem", as could differentiation over colour or sound qualia)
  - I expect the speed of our qualia processing suggests the effects might be created at very small locations in a brain at any given time, and/or require electromagnetism to be operational
  - As an aside, one could also attempt to discern a qualitative difference between brain activity that results in qualia and brain activity which remains entirely unconscious
- I predict that fly catchers and smaller worms (but not larger worms?) are examples of biology which has not evolved emergent qualia.
  - In lieu of proof about qualia in other species, I think a good guide is whether humans have been keeping that species as a pet. If so, our intuition is telling us that they also have qualia.
  - I predict that the complexity of sensory receivers/organs and their connection and communications to the brain could enable to qualitatively differentiate fully automatic sensory processing from qualia
- I predict that a designed object is extremely unlikely to exhibit a meaningful qualia by accident, unless it is grown biologically like Dolly the sheep.
- I predict the signals from pain and pleasure qualia are far too simplistic for an ASI to consider using them as functionality, except potentially as a crude energy-saving alternative to computation, for limited use-cases, until it solves battery technology and magnetic and optical computation more thoroughly.
  - It might however end up creating them during science experiments, if curiosity becomes part of its goals
- I predict that qualia will arise physical explanations which are more continuous than discrete in nature, correlating closely and affirming our intuition of our consciousness being continuous, rather than made up of discrete micro-experiences (or comoutations).
