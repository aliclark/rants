# Evolved Existence Programming

*Originally created 11th January 2024*

## Theory

In the course of evolution, a much more efficient method of computation was developed so that living organisms could survive better using less energy.

The trick that evolution pulled off was to learn how to tweak informational existence, in the manner that an advanced programmer might edit the text on their computer [using a magnet and a steady hand](https://xkcd.com/378/).

In doing so, the information being processed was also very cheaply brought into existence: our conscious experience.

## Predictions

I predict there is an information flow that passes from raw biology (input nerve signals and neural computations) then to conscious existence then to biology (neural computations and output signals).

The information processing which occurs in conscious experience is predicted to be performing some function more cheaply than could biology, else evolution would not have made the effort to use this method.

If consciousness is an information storage and retrieval system, there would be follow-on predictions based on what species would be most in need of an efficient information storage and retrieval system based on their environment and competitive landscape.

According to this theory, a successful investigation of the programming method should reveal a better understanding as to what the nature of existence is. There will be a correlation between the biological and physical structures & functioning, and the variation in the qualia existence when moving up the color spectrum, or along sound frequencies, or along feeling intensity. So looking at the physical aspect would give clues to the metaphysical aspect.

## Discussion

I think this might explain why our conscious experience feels very large - it costs almost nothing to create and operate, and larger is more helpful for survival. And existence has a timeless quality which makes consciousness feel timeless.

I think it's plausible that pain qualia is a straightforward feeling (like how red is straightforward - just another colour on the spectrum alongside blue), which small organisms are predisposed to react in certain ways to, and to which larger organisms additionally develop feelings of upset for additional pain avoidance.

It seems intuitive for me that the function which consciousness is used for is an information storage and retrieval system (ie. storage of what is currently relevant information). I speculate that it might also be echo-based, whereby the medium being transmitted into has some reflective property, such that at each time `t` a reflectance is received that contains information which was emitted at time `t-1`, and at each time `t` a new signal is emitted (or continuously "hummed"). Such a system would make the most sense if it was very efficient to drop parts of the received signal and add in new parts when creating a fresh emission.

Although a sketch is given above in discrete terms, I only do so for explanatory purposes. The actual nature could be much more substantial and even contain mechanics which allow for formless beings in this vibrational calculus. It is unclear to what extent one person's mind cosmology corresponds to another's. They may for all intents and purposes be 100% separate for all beings (while of course connected by shared Physics). They may have some potential to subtly bleed into or cross over with one another, or they may be one and the same.

We should be somewhat wary of any biological or physical work that is substantially similar to what biology has evolved. ie. if you create Dolly the Sheep or a brain in a vat and get it wrong, you have literally created an unknowable hell.

We should be careful of this computational power being used for malicious intent.

I think this theory validates the spiritual and religious teachings about cultivation of one's mind.

## Further work

What is the nature of the substrate on which both our Physical world and Conscious world is based?

How easy is it for one conscious experience on the shared substrate of existence to have influence on another, and vice versa? Impossible? In a way that only the most intuitive could discern? Directly? ie. Can mind-reading of any form be repeatedly experimentally validated? For instance by putting Yogis with ear defenders on the opposite side of a thin divider from other Yogis and control subjects.

How closely does it correlate to the Buddha's map of the cosmos or Yogic and other spiritualist or religious perspectives?
