## Theory

In the course of evolution, a much more efficient method of computation was developed so that living organisms could survive better using less energy.

The trick that evolution pulled off was to learn how to tweak formlessness in existence, in the manner that an advanced programmer might easily edit the text on their computer [using a magnet and a steady hand](https://xkcd.com/378/).

In doing so, the information being processed was also cheaply molded in existence: our conscious experience.

## Predictions

I predict there is an information flow that passes from raw biology (input nerve signals and neural computations) then to conscious existence then to biology (neural computations and output signals).

The information processing which occurs in conscious experience is predicted to be performing some function more cheaply than could biology, else evolution would not have made the effort to use this method.

If consciousness is an information storage and retrieval system, there would be follow-on predictions based on what species would be most in need of an efficient information storage and retrieval system based on their environment and competitive landscape.

According to this theory, a successful investigation of the programming method should reveal a better understanding as to what the nature of existence is. There will be a correlation between the biological and physical structures & functioning, and the variation in the qualia existence when moving up the color spectrum, or along sound frequencies, or along feeling intensity. So looking at the physical aspect would give clues to the metaphysical (formless) aspect.

If one swaps out even just one neuron with a replacement neuron that did not implement all of the requisite Physics behaviour, conscious experience could be disrupted or altered. But replacing the original neuron back the way it had been should be ok. To a great extent the hard problem gets much smaller from fully resolving the "easier parts" of the problem. If you make a replica of yourself and it reports no consciousness, then the replica is incorrectly duplicated. If it reports consciousness (unless you yourself are a mischievous type), then the replica is true and conscious, or mistakenly replicated in a most unlikely way that causes it to lie on this point while being not obviously a faulty replication through any other data.

## Discussion

Note that some of these arguments are founded on the difference between what is in principle and what is pragmatically the case. The difference accounts for most of the seeming contradictions with previous arguments relating to the hard problem of consciousness, which starting from a more abstract point could necessaily only depend on the principle and thus are very general. But evidence from the pragmatics of evolution are important guiding facts that we can leverage in combination with our starting point of our own conscious experience. What cannot necessarily be said in principle (and this theory does not dispute that), can in many cases be said from pragmatics. So what of those other cases in principle - consciousnesses that could exist? Well I still think pragmatics and Physics can go a long way to understanding existence as we know it, but there will always be existence beyond, which is where principle and philosophy retain their role.

I don't disagree that consciousness is different from Physics as we know it, but what I argue is that the correspondence between consciousness and the true, fully understood Physics of the brain is so closely related and dependent that looking at how the brain operates, and interpreting it through a theory of its effect on a formless level of existence, will give as good an understanding as one needs, and may significantly blur the line between the physical and what was previously considered metaphysical (formlessness). While it is a somewhat physicalst theory, it considers consciousness to be existing at a more native plain of existence, if not something like a kind of physical energy.

I think this theory might explain why our conscious experience feels very large - it costs almost nothing to create and operate, and larger is more helpful for survival. And existence has a timeless quality which makes consciousness feel timeless (when accurately synchronized with biology).

The theory is agnostic as to whether the relationship is \[Existence -> ... -> Formless -> ... Form] (parent-child), or whether it is \[Existence -> ... -> Substrate -> ... -> Formless] and \[Existence -> ... -> Substrate -> ... -> Form] (sibling). Arguably, both of these could be called monism or dualism depending on how you would want to split the hairs. But clearly it *could* be possible to describe all that exists in a single formula if it is the former, whereas it might never transpire to find a unified formula in the latter. Personally, based on the formulation of the theory, I think the former definition lends itself as the better candidate for it. Clearly, they are both able to agree on a shared definition of time.

I think it's plausible that pain qualia is a straightforward feeling (like how red is straightforward - just another colour on the spectrum alongside blue), which small organisms are predisposed to react in certain ways to, and to which larger organisms additionally develop feelings of upset for additional pain avoidance. I assume that there is a genuine thing such as feeling-space and a genuine thing such as colour-space. I assume that evolution has shuffled about and settled on the space positions and vectors that it has today for humans, but I believe that 400 million years ago the first fishes had a very, *very*, funky time of it. To a lesser extent, any animal fetus also, as the brain grows its structures.

To summarize, evolution settled on this approximate ballpark of feelings in existence space. As a human you have evolution to blame for the choice of "blue" to be "approximately 450–485 nm wavelength, rather than "cyan". Moreover they are fixed in relative place due to the wavelengh measuring apparatus and the absolute realities of the colour space of reality. However, granted that mine might be shifted from yours by a couple nm in either direction, so that when we look at the same picture I am seeing it slightly more towards "cyan" (but not much more, owing to pragmatics). As for what "blue" is, it is just one of many possibilities of what existence had to offer. Remember that the brain is constrained by evolutionary pressures so cannot be too resource-intensive - the choices available to the brain were limited to what could be reached economically. Jazzier feeling spaces were just too costly to reach and explore. "Blue" is alright, though, it works for me.

Thinking is usually implemented as an auditory experience, though I had a clever friend once for whom it was especially implemented in visual experience. The human brain has auditory and visual experiences as (some of its) available ingredients to represent information.

It seems intuitive for me that the function which consciousness is used for is an information storage and retrieval system (ie. storage of what is currently relevant information). I speculate that it might also be akin to [Delay-line memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay-line_memory), whereby the medium being transmitted into has some reflective property, such that at each time `t` a reflectance is received that contains information which was emitted at time `t-1`, and at each time `t` a new signal is emitted (or continuously "hummed"). Such a system would make the most sense if it was very efficient to drop parts of the received signal and add in new parts when creating a fresh emission, as well as efficiently attend to (select) parts of the signal.

Although a sketch is given above in discrete terms, I only do so for explanatory purposes. The actual nature could be much more substantial and even contain mechanics which allow for formless beings in this vibrational calculus. It is unclear to what extent one person's mind cosmology corresponds to another's. They may for all intents and purposes be 100% separate for all beings (while of course being connected significantly via the shared factor of Physics, both in being and in flows of information). They may have some potential to subtly bleed into or cross over with one another, or they may be one and the same. One might, in part, define spiritual practice as the process of becoming "at one" with any ambiguity herein.

The brain's processing of sound data is faster than its processing of visual data. If these ideas are true, does the brain "transmit" the processed sound data to our conscious experience at an earlier time than the visual data, but somehow in a way that causes it to travel slower than the visual data, so they synchronise at another location after the transmission?

I suppose a likely location of the relevant physics to be in or around the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus. An alternative idea is that instead of intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus being a send and receive transmitter, it is only a receive transmitter and the behaviour of the rest of the brain causes a unified signal to arrive at a pinpoint location to be read. At that location, all of the signals whether implemented in Physics we know or not know currently converge together into the existence of a conscious experience.

If it were purely a combination of gamma, alpha, beta, etc. waves, then seeing those waves outside of the brain, we might discern that while those waves exist, there is actually corresponding conscious experience somewhere in the universe (and we should be very careful about creating signals in these frequencies ignorantly). This follows the idea of Arche or Platonic Forms, which we in Physics measure as wavelengths but at the same time are not just wavelengths but directly specific flavours of conscious existence in themselves, and needing no human brain for them to be existing as so. We can test whether it is *directly so* by placing mice and humans in a pure purple environment and a pure light blue environment and measuring the brain waves.

A pertinent question to explore is the manner of programming. Is it like shaking a table cloth to excite waves? Is it like an endless conveyor belt which permits your voice to echo from side walls as you continuously move along it. Is it like a boundless notepad that you can scribble on almost at will? etc.

We should be somewhat wary of any biological or physical work that is substantially similar to what biology has evolved. ie. if you create Dolly the Sheep or a brain in a vat and get it wrong, you have literally created an unknowable hell.

We should be careful of this computational power being used for malicious intent.

I think this theory validates the spiritual and religious teachings about cultivation of one's mind.

The Buddha believed that philosophy based on wholeness of consciousness and mind were less helpful an understanding than the dhamma that he taught, likely this was due partly to it being harder to "let go" the concepts after they had served their purpose than it would be when using his dhamma.

## Further work

What is the nature of the substrate on which both our Physical world and Conscious world is based?

How easy is it for one conscious experience on the shared substrate of existence to have influence on another, and vice versa? Impossible? In a way that only the most intuitive could discern? Directly? ie. Can mind-reading of any form be repeatedly experimentally validated? For instance by putting Yogis with ear defenders on the opposite side of a thin divider from other Yogis and control subjects.

How closely does it correlate to the Buddha's map of the cosmos or Yogic and other spiritualist or religious perspectives?

How much storage capacity is in the human conscious experience?

How much is in unconscious existence (not encoded as state in the physical brain, but in formlessness)? I currently assume it would be evolutionarily inefficient, but who knows.
