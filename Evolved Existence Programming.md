# Evolved Existence Programming

*Originally created 11th January 2024*

In the course of evolution, a much more efficient method of computation was developed so that living organisms could survive better using less energy.

The trick that evolution pulled off was to learn how to tweak informational existence, in the manner that an advanced programmer might edit the text on their computer using a magnet and a steady hand.

In doing so, the thing computed was also *very cheaply* brought into existence: our conscious experience.

This is why our conscious experience feels very large - it costs almost nothing to create and operate, and larger is more helpful for survival.
