# Evolved Existence Programming

*Originally created 11th January 2024*

## Theory

In the course of evolution, a much more efficient method of computation was developed so that living organisms could survive better using less energy.

The trick that evolution pulled off was to learn how to tweak informational existence, in the manner that an advanced programmer might edit the text on their computer using a magnet and a steady hand.

In doing so, the thing computed was also *very cheaply* brought into existence: our conscious experience.

This is why our conscious experience feels very large - it costs almost nothing to create and operate, and larger is more helpful for survival.

## Predictions

I predic there is an information flow that passes from raw biology (input nerve signals and neural computations) then to conscious existence then to biology (neural computations and output signals).

The information processing which occurs in conscious experience is predicted to be performing some function more cheaply than could biology, else evolution would not have made the effort to use this method.

## Discussion

We should be somewhat wary of any biological or physical work that is substantially similar to what biology has evolved. ie. if you create Dolly the Sheep or a brain in a vat and get it wrong, you have literally created an unknowable hell.

We should be careful of this computational power being used for malicious intent.

I think this theory validates the spiritual and religious teachings about cultivation of one's mind.
