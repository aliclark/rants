# Evolved Existence Programming

*Originally created 11th January 2024*

## Theory

In the course of evolution, a much more efficient method of computation was developed so that living organisms could survive better using less energy.

The trick that evolution pulled off was to learn how to tweak informational existence, in the manner that an advanced programmer might edit the text on their computer [using a magnet and a steady hand](https://xkcd.com/378/).

In doing so, the information being processed was also very cheaply brought into existence: our conscious experience.

## Predictions

I predict there is an information flow that passes from raw biology (input nerve signals and neural computations) then to conscious existence then to biology (neural computations and output signals).

The information processing which occurs in conscious experience is predicted to be performing some function more cheaply than could biology, else evolution would not have made the effort to use this method.

If consciousness is an information storage and retrieval system, there would be follow-on predictions based on what species would be most in need of an efficient information storage and retrieval system based on their environment and competitive landscape.

According to this theory, a successful investigation of the programming method should reveal a better understanding as to what the nature of existence is. There will be a correlation between the biological and physical structures & functioning, and the variation in the qualia existence when moving up the color spectrum, or along sound frequencies, or along feeling intensity. So looking at the physical aspect would give clues to the metaphysical (formless) aspect.

If one swaps out even just one neuron with a replacement neuron that did not implement all of the requisite Physics behaviour, conscious experience could be disrupted or altered. But replacing the original neuron back the way it had been should be ok. To a great extent the hard problem gets much smaller from fully resolving the "easier parts" of the problem. If you make a replica of yourself and it reports no consciousness, then the replica is incorrectly duplicated. If it reports consciousness (unless you yourself are a mischievous type), then the replica is true and conscious, or mistakenly replicated in a most unlikely way that causes it to lie on this point while being not obviously faulty replication.

## Discussion

I think this might explain why our conscious experience feels very large - it costs almost nothing to create and operate, and larger is more helpful for survival. And existence has a timeless quality which makes consciousness feel timeless (when accurately synchronized with biology).

I think it's plausible that pain qualia is a straightforward feeling (like how red is straightforward - just another colour on the spectrum alongside blue), which small organisms are predisposed to react in certain ways to, and to which larger organisms additionally develop feelings of upset for additional pain avoidance. I assume that there is a genuine thing such as feeling-space and a genuine thing such as colour-space. I assume that evolution has shuffled about and settled on the space positions and vectors that it has today for humans, but I believe that 400 million years ago the first fishes had a very, *very*, funky time of it. To a lesser extent, any animal fetus also, as the brain grows its structures.

To summarize, evolution settled on this approximate ballpark of feelings in existence space. You have evolution to blame for the choice of "blue" to be "approximately 450–485 nm wavelength, rather than "cyan". Moreover they are fixed in relative place due to the wavelengh measuring apparatus and the absolute realities of the colour space of reality. However, granted that mine might be shifted from yours by a couple nm in either direction, so that when we look at the same picture I am seeing it slightly more towards "cyan". As for what "blue" is, it is just one of many possibilities of what existence had to offer. Remember that the brain is constrained by evolutionary pressures so cannot be too resource-intensive - the choices available to the brain were limited to what could be reached economically. Jazzier feeling spaces were just too costly to reach and explore. "Blue" is alright, though, it works for me.

Thinking is usually implemented as an auditory experience, though I had a clever friend once for whom it was especially implemented in visual experience. The human brain has auditory and visual experiences as (some of its) available ingredients to represent information.

It seems intuitive for me that the function which consciousness is used for is an information storage and retrieval system (ie. storage of what is currently relevant information). I speculate that it might also be akin to [Delay-line memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay-line_memory), whereby the medium being transmitted into has some reflective property, such that at each time `t` a reflectance is received that contains information which was emitted at time `t-1`, and at each time `t` a new signal is emitted (or continuously "hummed"). Such a system would make the most sense if it was very efficient to drop parts of the received signal and add in new parts when creating a fresh emission, as well as efficiently attend to (select) parts of the signal.

Although a sketch is given above in discrete terms, I only do so for explanatory purposes. The actual nature could be much more substantial and even contain mechanics which allow for formless beings in this vibrational calculus. It is unclear to what extent one person's mind cosmology corresponds to another's. They may for all intents and purposes be 100% separate for all beings (while of course being connected significantly via the shared factor of Physics, both in being and in flows of information). They may have some potential to subtly bleed into or cross over with one another, or they may be one and the same. One might, in part, define spiritual practice as the process of becoming "at one" with any ambiguity herein.

A pertinent question to explore is the manner of existence alteration. Is it like shaking a table cloth to excite waves? Is it like an endless conveyor belt which permits your voice to echo from side walls as you continuously move along it. Is it like a boundless notepad that you can scribble on almost at will? etc.

We should be somewhat wary of any biological or physical work that is substantially similar to what biology has evolved. ie. if you create Dolly the Sheep or a brain in a vat and get it wrong, you have literally created an unknowable hell.

We should be careful of this computational power being used for malicious intent.

I think this theory validates the spiritual and religious teachings about cultivation of one's mind.

The Buddha believed that philosophy based on wholeness of consciousness and mind were less helpful an understanding than the dhamma that he taught, likely this was due partly to it being harder to "let go" the concepts after they had served their purpose than it would be when using his dhamma.

## Further work

What is the nature of the substrate on which both our Physical world and Conscious world is based?

How easy is it for one conscious experience on the shared substrate of existence to have influence on another, and vice versa? Impossible? In a way that only the most intuitive could discern? Directly? ie. Can mind-reading of any form be repeatedly experimentally validated? For instance by putting Yogis with ear defenders on the opposite side of a thin divider from other Yogis and control subjects.

How closely does it correlate to the Buddha's map of the cosmos or Yogic and other spiritualist or religious perspectives?
